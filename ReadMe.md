## Introduction

PiSpace is a project designed to replace the mainboard controller of generic Chinese diesel heaters with an opensource feature rich smart controller based on the esp32 platform. The documentation for this project is built using [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), a static site generator tailored for clean and professional documentation.
